# C++ modules

#### Status: ongoing

## About

The objective of these modules is to give an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming:  
|Summary List|

|[C++00](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp00): Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static and const keywords|  
|[C++01](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp01): Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements|
|[C++02](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp02): Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, the Orthodox Canonical class form and Fixed-point|
|[C++03](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp03): Inheritance|
|C++04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces|
|C++05: Repetition and exceptions|
|C++06: C++ casts|
|C++07: C++ templates|  
|C++08: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms|
|C++09: Standard Template Library (STL)|

### Message to students

If you are searching resources to learn more about your own C++ modules, I encourage you to turn to your peers and the function manuals. Do not implement any code you do not understand and cannot code from scratch.
