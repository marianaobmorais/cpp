# C++ modules

#### Status: ongoing

## About

The objective of these modules is to give an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming:

[C++00](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp00): Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static and const keywords.  
[C++01](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp01): Memory allocation, pointers to members, references and switch statements.  
[C++02](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cpp/tree/main/cpp02/): Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and the Orthodox Canonical class form.  
C++03: Inheritance.  
C++04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces.  


As required per the 42 school's syllabus, the modules follow the C++98 standard.

### Message to students

If you are searching resources to learn more about your own C++ modules, I encourage you to turn to your peers and the function manuals. Do not implement any code you do not understand and cannot code from scratch.
